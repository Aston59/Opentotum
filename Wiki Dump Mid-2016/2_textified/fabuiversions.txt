FABtotum USER INTERFACE




Check the FABtotum User Interface official Repo here. 



Version: 0.954 - (02/02/2016) (hotifx)


• Firmware

◦ Fixed a bug with timing when using M3,M4,M5


◦ Subtractive gcodes will not require a G4 before M5 or after M3 and M4 like before.. M3,M4 and M5 will in fact start spinning after 1.5 seconds the last movement operation is completed. This allows to use some standard Gcode Posts processors instead of manually editing the code with pauses



• Maintenance

◦ Head renamed in “Head installation”


◦ Spool rename in “Spool management”



• Settings

◦ Hardware

◾ Added tab “Print” for the parametric management of pre-heating temperatures

GENERAL Out of the three first capabilities of the FABtotum, scanning option has always been difficult to be used. Results were not always reliable and satisfying. We worked hard on this as we wanted to offer you a better product. In the upcoming months we will focus even more to have you less stressed when postprocessing. Shapes will be less deformed, the camera is going to add colours and details to the final result. We will tell you more as soon as we have news and we will always update our development log on the forum as well. 

The FABtotum hardware can be updated with addons and so on. The latest FABUI will check the hardware revision number (Saved in the Totumduino EEPROM) and will apply custom preferences, show or hide menu options etc.) You can set or view the hardware revision of the FABtotum by going to the MDI and looking up the Gcode M763 in the gcode table. This is pretty usefull if you want to change some components of the machine or if you follow the active project keeping the FABtotum up to date. This first step in revision numbering will be also used for the introduction of the Hybrid head v2.

FABUI 0.85 (13/03/2015)


GENERAL The primary focus has been improving the user experience by increasing the responsiveness of the application to user inputs as well as internal logging. Web Sockets have been added for leaner communication with the device, where supported by the browser. If the browser doesn't support Web Sockets, the old Ajax Json interaction mode has been provided for backward compatibility on older browsers. You can get a web socket compatibility list here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#Browser_support. The Boot process, initially based on a cron event and a arbitrary timeout of 60 seconds, is now controlled by a init script that check whenever all the required services for the FAB UI are started or not. The unit ambient light will turn to it's default color only when the FAB UI is really accessible. This has also slightly reduced boot times and will avoid any instance when a service (e.g. Mysql) is not yet available. Improved in general user experience using the potential of the web socket
