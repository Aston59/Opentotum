Printing Head V2






fabtotum_print_head_new_01_front_1.jpg 

The V2 head is the last printing head available for the FABtotum. It replaces the old Hybrid head. 

It looks mostly the same, but its hotend was complitely re designed. It's featured with a cold end body made in aluminium, heatbreak and interchangeable nozzle. 

Now it's easier to reach high temperatures for print more materials, like ABS, NYLON, ecc.. 

It can be bought on the FAbtotum store here.
