Updates


It's very important to update the software of the FABtotum: we are continuously developing and releasing upgrades. 
 It's very easy to update your fabtotum. 

When the FABtotum is connected to internet it checks for updates, if it finds a new package, a notification will appear near to the “Updates” tab in the FABUI. 

 

By clicking the button “Update”, the interface will ask you to confirm to update, click “yes”.
The FABtotum will start to download and install the update. 

 

After few seconds the FABtotum may reboot. The updating process is done.
