File managing


 

In the main menu of the FABUI you can find the “Object Manager” section.
 This section contains all the files loaded inside the onboard SD card.
 The Object manager is like an archive where each “object” can contain multiple files. 
 An object can contain additive and subractive files as well as scanned files.
 You can create a new object and upload a new file by clicking “Add new”. 

 

An object is a folder that can contain many different files, for example the “Infill shape” object contains 7 files.
 You can enter the files list by clicking the object name.
 From the “object manager”, you can delete an object or modify it, like changing the name, the description, upload new files or deleting some.
