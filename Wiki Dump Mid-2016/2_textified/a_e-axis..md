A/E Axis

The Feeder motor doubles as a rotary axis, therefore is identified by two aliases depending of the use and the context.
It is the extruder feeder axis, is controlled by the gcode with the “E” parameter.
It can be used as “E” axis for the laser scanning or for 4 Axis milling.
The FABUI automatically changes the steps per unit depending on the selected mode.
