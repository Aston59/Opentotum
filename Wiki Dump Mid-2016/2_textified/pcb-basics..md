When designing a PCB (or any circuit board) the inevitable question will arise sooner or later, 

what maximum current can I apply on my design. 

I personally found this short Table very helpful. Note that 35 µm copper thickness is sometimes referred to as 1 ounce or 1 oz, while 70 µm copper thickness is sometimes referred to as 2 ounce or 2 oz. 

The current - carrying - capacitor of copper tracks on base material 

A track 1.5 mm wide on 35 µm copper will heat to approx. 10 °C above room temperature 

when a 3 amp current is applied. These values may vary greatly depending on the 

structure of the board of the board and on the environment and air circulation.
