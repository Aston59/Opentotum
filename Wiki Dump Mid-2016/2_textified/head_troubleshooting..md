Head troubleshooting



Pre flight check


Before you use an head you just installed, check if the thermistor is correctly working: in “Jog” you will see the temperature bar showing the room temperature. Touching the nozzle (when cold), you can see a slowly increasing temperature. 

Clogged nozzle


Possible causes: Bed too close, high temperatures, bad filaments. 

For solve this problem, try the “Atomic method” 

Temperture not increasing


Cause A: The head is not properly connected to the flex. 

Solution: Check if the connection pins between the head and carriage are clean and well aligned. 

Cause B: Shortcircuit (Rare). 

Solution:  (Try the Resistance testing, Here). 

Cause C: High temperatures for long time (After 8 minutes for safety the FABtotum stops heating both bed and head) 

Solution: Try to increase the temperature again. 

Cause D: You damaged the thermistor when opening the head. 

Solution:  (Try the Thermistor testing, Here ). 

Bent nozzle


Cause A: Bed too close, high pressure.
