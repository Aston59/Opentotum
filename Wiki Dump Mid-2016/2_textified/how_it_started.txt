The FABtotum is a multipurpose tool, the world's first Low Cost Desktop Personal Fabrication device that can operate a wide range of computer controlled manufacturing (CNC) and 3D-scanning processes. Print, Cut, Mill, Scan, Manipulate. Rinse and repeat! A seamless interaction between the physical and the digital world. While current 3D printers are defined as personal fabricators, there is so much more to personal fabrication than 3D printing alone! The FABtotum allows anyone to explore the endless possibilities of a multipurpose fabrication device.
