Hybrid bed troubleshooting

Most common problems on the hybrid bed:

    The printer doesn't recognise the hybrid bed

Cause: The connection between the bed and the printer doesn't work

Solution: Try to remove the bed, and install back again. Unscrew the 4 screws that sustain the bed, so the bed will stay closer to the connectors.

    There are some small burning tracks on the printer side connector

Cause: The pin connectors doesn't work properly, and electric arch is generated between the connectors.

Solution: Check if some pin is bent, if yes try to fix it by bending back.
