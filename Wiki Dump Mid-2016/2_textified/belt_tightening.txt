Belt tightening

A not-tightened belt can cause problems during the printing or milling.
If your prints look like this, probably your belts aren't well tightened (we intentionally exaggerated the loosing of the belt for show the lack).

You can test if the belts are well calibrated by pushing them in the frontal part of the printer: you have to push (gently) the belt until you feel the belt starts to make resistance to your stress, at this point the belt should be 1 cm (0,5 inch) from the standard position.
Both belts need to have the same tension.
NOTICE: belts too tightened aren't good: they force the stepper motors, they can loose steps, with the same result of not tightened belts.

If the belts aren't well tightened, you can make a gross calibration by removing where the belt is blocked acting on the point n°1 in the picture and fastening it more or less tightened.
For make a fine calibration you have to act on the grub (n°2): as more is inserted as tightened is the belt.

Do the same procedure with the lower belt and act on the other side of the carriage (the direction how to insert the belt is opposite).

If you have this problem, but the belts look well tightened, the problem might be caused by loo pulleys.
