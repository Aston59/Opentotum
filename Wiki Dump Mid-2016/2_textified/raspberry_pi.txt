Raspberry PI


In the FABtotum you can find a Raspberry Pi 1 model B
 

Specs



Memory


512MB RAM 

Connections


2 USB ports
 Ethernet port
 3.5mm jack for audio out
 HDMI
 Composite Video 

Processor


SoC is a Broadcom BCM2835
 This contains an ARM1176JZFS (ARM11 using an ARMv6-architecture core) with floating point, running at 700Mhz, and a Videocore 4 GPU.
 GPU
 The first version of the GPU used came out in 2009.
 Capable of BluRay quality playback, using H.264 at 40MBits/s.
 Has a fast 3D core accessed using the supplied OpenGL ES2.0 and OpenVG libraries.
 Provides Open GL ES 2.0, hardware-accelerated OpenVG, and 1080p30 H.264 high-profile decode.
 Capable of 1Gpixel/s, 1.5Gtexel/s or 24 GFLOPs of general purpose compute and features a bunch of texture filtering and DMA infrastructure.
 That is, graphics capabilities are roughly equivalent to Xbox 1 level of performance.
 Overall real world performance is something like a 300MHz Pentium 2, only with much, much swankier graphics. 

Operating Temperature Range


Limiting Components
 The LAN9512 (USB and Ethernet IC) is specified as 0°C to 70°C (the commercial temperature range part is used on the RPi – part number is “LAN9512-JZX”, not “LAN9512i-JZX” indicating industrial temperature range)
