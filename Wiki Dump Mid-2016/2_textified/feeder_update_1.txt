FABtotum Feeder Update



Purpose


The FABtotum feeder is projected to be used also as 4th axis for 3d scanning or for turning milling. 

This short tutorial will allow you to take off the button originally used to switch between 

FABtotum's functions. 

What you need




 

• Philips screwdriver,


• Flat screwdriver,


• Nippers tool,


• Awl tool.


Procedure


1. Remove the printing bed being careful not to ruin the pogo pins; 




2. Update your FabUI first. Once done, go to JOG (1), digit G27 (2) and click “Run” (3): the printing platform will get down to the lower position.

3. Using the “Z” button (see step 4 on the previously image), raise the platform until you will see the black button of the feeder in the hole (should be around 14-16mm upper); 




4. Switch off your FABtotum using the FABUI.


5. Switch off your FABtotum using the physical button. Remove the power supply cord and, if you have it, the ethernet cable;


6. Open the spool side;


7. Open the electronic side (remember to remove the screw in the lower right corner first);


8. Remove all the 4 screws which hold the back panel; 



9. Gently remove the back panel being careful not to pull the AC cables. Leave the back cover near the FABtotum while you are working on it; 



10. Locate the Seeger ring on the shaft; 



11. Remove it using the awl tool;


12. While pushing the aluminium plate in the upper direction (the spring is quite hard), push the shaft using the awl tool; 



13. The aluminium plate has a rib, you have to cut it using the nippers tool or a small saw; 



14. Looking inside the FABtotum you will see the shaft with the black plastic button out from its original position: pull it gently; 
 



15. Place the back cover of the printer in its original position and fasten it using the 4 original screws;


16. Place both side covers and hold the electronic side one using the screw.


17. On the FABUI go to “Settings” (1) –> Hardware (2) —> “Feeder” (3) and set the value on “no” (4). Press “Save” and reload the page. 



18. FINISHED!
