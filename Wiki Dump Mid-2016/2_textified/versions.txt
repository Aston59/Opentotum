FABtotum Versions


The FABtotum “Version” identifies what features and changes are implemented over the standard version (vers 1).
 Versions are cumulative, so Version 2 includes the changes in V1.
 Versions are cross-compatible and an higher version does not mean it won't be compatible with newer parts.
 In fact you can upgrade your FABtotum hardware and set the new version on your FABUI.

 How to know your FABtotum version: 

Go to “Jog” and type: M763, then press “Run” the printer will answer you the version number. :
