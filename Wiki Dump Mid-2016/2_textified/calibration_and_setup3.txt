Calibration

Calibration of the FABtotum is a critical step in all future operations. A non-calibrated unit is unable to perform most basic tasks like printing and milling. Wrong calibration could damage the unit.

After unboxing, setting up the machine and connecting to it, you'll be prompted with a setup/configuration.
After the first setup you'll be able to use the “calibration wizard” (either clicking on the pop-up alert or going to Maintenance → first setup).

You can do all the wizard operations manually by using the Maintenance menu.
