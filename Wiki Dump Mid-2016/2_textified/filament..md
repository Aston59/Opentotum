Filament


The FABtotum accepts 1.75mm filaments in PLA or ABS spools.
 You can find a selection of tested filaments on the FABtotum store store.fabtotum.com/eu/store/filaments.html
 They are fitted in the right compartment.
 You can use different spool size, the maximum dimension to close the compartment are: 200mm diameter and 55mm width 

There is an easy to print spool holder available here. Print it and fasten it on the right compartment of the printer using an M3 screw.

If you have bigger spool you can use it outside the printer by adding a spool holder.
 You can find an extended holder designed by our user imarin on Thingiverse here.
