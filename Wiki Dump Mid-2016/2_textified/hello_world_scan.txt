Hello world (scanning)


There are different methods for 3D scanning an object, with the FABtotum you can decide the best one, depending on the geometry of the object, final result, post-processing work, ecc.. 

 

Rotating scanning method


Laser line is projected on an object placed on an incrementally rotating platform. A 3D model can be acquired when a full 360° rotation is complete. It is the most common laser scanning method 
Accuracy: medium 
Time of acquisition: short

Sweep scanning method


The laser is moved across the object with or without the object rotation. Use this method to fix holes and shadows of existing scans.Selective scan is possible.
Accuracy: low 
Time of acquisition: short.

Probing scanning method


Based on physical contact of the probe with an object, this method gives best results for flat and small surface features, e.g. a coin. Can be used on 3 or 4 axis. Localized probing is possible. 
Accuracy:  high 
Time of acquisition: long

Photogrammetry scanning method


Structure from motion (SfM) is a range imaging technique; it refers to the process of estimating three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences which may be coupled with local motion signals.
Accuracy:  medium 
Time of acquisition: short
