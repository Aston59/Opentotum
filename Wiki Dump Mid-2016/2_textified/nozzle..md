The Nozzle Holder portion of the extruder is made from PEEK, a thermoplastic polymer. Due to its melting point of around 248°C, the extruder cannot handle high temperatures well as this can affect the Nozzle Holder. The recommendations are to use PLA or ABS filaments due to the higher temperature required for other filament polymers. 

Sometimes, the nozzle can become clogged for various reasons. To clean the nozzle, you can follow the recommendations on Nozzle Cleaning.
