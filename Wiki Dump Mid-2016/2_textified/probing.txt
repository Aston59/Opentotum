Probing scanning


This scanning method is the most accurate, but the slowest. 
 It uses the probe embedded in the FABtotum carriage for reconstruct the geometry of the object to be scanned.
 It's working with object without undercut, like coins, medals ecc… 

Scanning procedure


1. In the dashboard, select “Scan” (eye icon), Insert the name of the new object you are scanning, select the scanning method “Probing”, then “next” to continue the scanning procedure.


2. Now you are setting the scanning parameters. Select the probing area coordinates. You can both select the area on the image, or write the coordinates; 
 In this step you can decide the quality of the scan, choose one from: 
Draft:  1 Probe per square millimiters 
Low: 4 Probes per square millimiters 
Medium: 16 Probes per square millimiters 
High: 64 Probes per square millimiters 
Very high: 100 Probes per square millimiters 
Ultra high: 256 Probes per square millimiters 

 Then click “Next” to start the scan. 

 




3. Your scan has started! 
 The probe will start to softly touch your object and in few minutes (depending on the area, and the quality you selected) the scan will finish.

4. After the scanning process the guided procedure will ask you to download an .sc file: it's the point cloud coming from your scan. 
 You can process it for have an .stl available for your 3d printer using different programs.
