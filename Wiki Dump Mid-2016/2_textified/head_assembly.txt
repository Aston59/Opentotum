Hybrid head V 1.0



 The Hybrid head is one of the last finalized parts of the Personal fabricator, 
 We improved many specs of this part, starting from the onboard milling motor which is now a 200W brushless beast, with custom-made high-precision ER-8 collet for improved quality. 
 We started from something like this and we ended with this: 



 Switching from subtractive to additive mode requires a fixed offset instead of manual adjustments. As you may also notice, endstops, lasers, lights and probe are fixed on the carriage so that any optional head can be cheaper and made with the FABtotum itself. 

Removing the Head


To remove the head press the metallic tab on both sides of the head. 
 The left one will remain pushed (Not spring loaded), the right one, have to be pressed while removing the head. 
 This is normal by design and helps removing the head with 2 hands.
