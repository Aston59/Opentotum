SD Card Troubleshooting


There is mainly a cause for failure of the SD: bad turning off, if you didn't switched off the FABtotum using the correct procedure (Clicking on the “Switch off” button on the top-right corner of the FABUI), while the FABtotum is working (reading/writing), some files can be corrupted, avoiding the correct working of the entire SD.
 In case of problems check how to flash the SD card here.
