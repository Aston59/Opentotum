Samples


(Under construction) 

Since the FABUI version n 0.9499 (Only for the new installations, check this page) an increased number of samples are pre charged on the FABtotum.
 The gcodes are generated using Cura as slicing engine.
 They were studied to be printed using PLA, but you can print them also using ABS just modifying the nozzle and the bed temperatures.
 They are divided in easy and advanced:
