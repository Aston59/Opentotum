Materials


There are several materials could be used in 3D printing. 

For see how to load or unload the spools look here. 

With FABtotum could be used the following materials, it's highly raccomended to use the original FABtotum filaments, that are customized to work better with this printer, you can find them in the FABtotum store. 

PLA (Polylactic Acid)


It’s one of the most used material in 3D printing: it’s a biodegradable polymer that comes from corn. 

Print temperature: 200 - 220 °C
 Bed temperature: 0 - 60 °C (bed could be cold)
 Glass Transition Temperature: 60-65 °C

ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)




It’s a common plastic polymer, it’s used for strongest parts. Having an higher glass transition temperature could be used for make parts that are used in hotter conditions. 

Print temperature: 220 - 260 °C 
 Bed temperature: 80 - 110 °C 
 Glass Transition Temperature: 110 °C

NYLON


One of the stongest material you can find for 3D printing. It can be used for mechanical parts 

Print temperature:
 Bed temperature:
 Glass transition temperature:

Charged materials


Combining PLA or ABS with other materials can be possible to obtain different properties. Charging the polymers with materials like Carbon fibers, wood dust, metallic powder can make stronger materials, with nice finishing. Printing settings depends on the polymer used. 

Due to bowden extruder would be difficult to print flexible filaments like rubber or TPU.
